## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. <br>
    MDN https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
    w3schools https://www.w3schools.com/


2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)<br>
  Balancing school, and other responsibilities and finding the time to create my project was the most challenging aspect of creating this submission. At a first glance, the required tasks and the very small scroll bar made it seem like it would take a lot of time to complete all the necessary steps. But I was eager to complete the pre-task so I chose to start no matter what, even if it meant making really small progress each time. As I was not familiar with Glitch previous to this project, I decided to spare some time to just explore Glitch and how it worked. It took some looking around, creating several projects, and deleting them but in the end, I felt comfortable to start working on the game. The next couple steps were easier than I expected, I simply followed the directions I didn’t run into many problems. That was until I started implementing CSS rules. Because I was using a Glitch starter project, the style sheet already had some style rules which were affecting how my game looked. Rather than trying to understand each one and redesigning things to fit how my submission was supposed to be, I just created a blank style sheet and copied only the selectors needed. The rest of the project flowed easier, but whenever I got stuck or wanted to understand some instruction in greater deal, I would search for it and read more about it. The last part of the project, the submission, is also quite challenging as it requires more presentation, and effective wording skills. It is taking more time than bringing the project together, but I have managed to divide things into subtasks, and handle them one-by-one. Overall, I think I came over the challenges I faced by breaking my task into smaller parts, researching, and asking questions.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)<br>
  I’ve gathered quite a lot of questions while working on this project. For example, I’d really like to know how it differs to work in a team of web developers, than working alone. This particularly interests me because I’d like to know how the styling/theme is preserved through the project when different people are working on it. Another question I have is about the limits we have when it comes to implementing javascript, I’d like to explore what more can be done. I’d also like to learn more about how websites are made adjustable to both desktop and mobile. But my most prominent question is on how a website with millions of users can be deployed and maintained.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)<br>
  I would definitely add all the optional features listed in the prework and not just the few I had time to implement. Which would mean that I would add the 3 strikes, fancier buttons with decorations, and the ticking clock feature. But apart from what was suggested in that list, I would really like to add level options to the game. When the game starts the player should be asked to choose between the different difficulty levels that vary in the number of buttons and the time it takes for the game to pick up pace. After that I think it would only make sense to change the game to a scoring system rather than a win/loss, the different difficulty levels would have different score tables. This would make the game more interesting, and also desirable to play more and more. It would also be great to implement a worldwide score table, to see how the player compares to everyone else playing the game.
